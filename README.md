# MedShare
Repository of my thesis project, MedShare, a blockchain-based distributed file share and management system for medical data. 

## Notice
This repository only covers the codes that interact with the Hyperledger Fabric network, including codes for smart contracts(chain codes), file encryption, and server but does not include the network itself. The network used in this prototype is built upon the Hyperledger test network, including 3 organizations hosted in docker-compose containers, with specific configurations that suit the use case.
