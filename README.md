# MedShare
Repository of my thesis project, MedShare, a blockchain-based distributed file share and management system for medical data. 

## Notice
This repository only covers the codes that interact with the Hyperledger Fabric network, including codes for smart contracts(chain codes), file encryption, and server but does not include the network itself. The network used in this prototype is built upon the Hyperledger test network, including 3 organizations hosted in docker-compose containers, with specific configurations that suit the use case.

# Installation Guide

## Setting Up Hyperledger Fabric

Ensure you have Hyperledger Fabric v2.5 installed and running for this project. The platform operates within Docker containers. Follow the steps below to set up your environment.

### Prerequisites

- **Docker:** Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine. If not, you can download it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

- **Hyperledger Fabric v2.5:** Follow the steps below to install the Fabric on your machine:

### Installation Steps

1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Visit [Hyperledger Fabric Prerequisites](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prereqs.html) to set up the environment.

2. **Install Fabric and Fabric Samples:**
   - Follow the instructions on [Installing Hyperledger Fabric](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) to get Fabric and Fabric samples installed.

### Directory Structure

Ensure the "fabric-samples" folder is installed parallel to this project's repository. The relative path should be `"../fabric-samples"`.

## Setting Up Two Local Kubo IPFS Nodes

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Go installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install it from [the official Go website](https://golang.org/).

### Step 1: Install Kubo

- Follow the official instructions on [Installing Hyperledger Fabric](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/command-line/#system-requirements) to get a IPFS Kubo(a Go-based IPFS implementation) installed on your machine.

### Step 2: Initialize the First IPFS Node
Make sure you are in the MedShare repository, then create a new directory for the first IPFS node and initialize it:

```bash
mkdir -p storage/.ipfs1
export IPFS_PATH=./storage/.ipfs1
ipfs init
```

### Step 3: Initialize the Second IPFS Node

Create a new directory for the second IPFS node and initialize it:

```bash
mkdir -p storage/.ipfs2
export IPFS_PATH=./storage/.ipfs2
ipfs init
```

### Step 4: Start the First IPFS Node

In the first terminal, start the first IPFS node:

```bash
export IPFS_PATH=./storage/.ipfs1
ipfs daemon
```

### Step 5: Start the Second IPFS Node

Open a second terminal, navigate to the same directory, and start the second IPFS node:

```bash
cd path/to/your/storage/directory
export IPFS_PATH=./storage/.ipfs2
ipfs daemon
```

### Step 6: Find the Multiaddresses

In each terminal, you should see an output similar to this when the node starts:

```bash
API server listening on /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/5001
Gateway (readonly) server listening on /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/8080
Daemon is ready
```

Note down the API server addresses; you will need them to connect the nodes.

### Step 7: Connect the Nodes

Use the `swarm connect` command to connect the nodes. Replace `<node2-multiaddr>` with the API server address of the second node:

```bash
ipfs swarm connect <node2-multiaddr>
```

### Verification

Verify that the nodes are connected:

```bash
ipfs swarm peers
```

This should display the multiaddress of the other node, confirming that they are connected.

Now, you have two local Kubo IPFS nodes running and connected. You can start adding and retrieving files on either node. Make sure to replace `<node2-multiaddr>` with the actual multiaddress of your second IPFS node.
